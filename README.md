# robust-finetuning
Experiments on different strategies of fine-tuning LLMs evaluating the impact on robustness


## Research questions:

1. **Does prompting improve the robustness of LLMs?**
2. **What portion of robustness loss in conventional fine-tuning can be attributed to fitting the head?**

## Plan:

1. Evaluate ID+OOD of vanilla LM
2. Evaluate ID+OOD of PET
3. Evaluate classic fine-tuning: ID+OOD
4. Evaluate head transfer (1)
5. Evaluate iterative head transfer (2)
6. Evaluate Combined head transfer (3)
